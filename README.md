# 📊 SQL Retail Sales Analytics Project

This project showcases end-to-end SQL analysis using a **retail sales dataset**.  
It demonstrates practical SQL skills used daily in Business Analyst and Data Analyst roles.

## 🔍 Objective

Retail businesses need to understand:

- Which products generate the highest revenue?
- How do sales vary by customer demographics (age, gender)?
- What are the monthly and weekly sales trends?
- Who are the top customers?
- Which product categories perform best?

This project answers these questions using optimized SQL queries, CTEs, and window functions.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL-style syntax)**
- Grouping & filtering
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Date functions
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Window functions (`RANK`, `OVER`)
- Data segmentation (age groups, gender)
